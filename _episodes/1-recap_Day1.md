title: "Recap of Day 1: Raw sequence to counts"
teaching: 10
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How to use nfcore-rnaseq pipeline for differential expression analysis?"

objectives:
- "Recap Day 1: nfcore-rnaseq pipeline"


keypoints:
- We generated a gene-count matrix using the nfcore-rnaseq pipeline, using a single command.
- The gene-count matrix will be used today for identifying differentially expressed genes using DeSEq2.
